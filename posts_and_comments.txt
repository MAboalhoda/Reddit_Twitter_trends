The End of the PetroDollar has begun. Saudi considering selling some of its oil in Yuan.It's paywalled but most of you can't read anyway.

If Saudi sells 25% of its oil in Yuan, that's a pretty big deal.

The crown prince is already inviting Xi to visit. Xi hasn't left China in 2-3 years so if he does, it will be a another big deal.

# UPDATE: AMC to acquire 22% of gold and silver miner Hycroft in surprise move

 Ciara Linnane - 30m ago 

MARKET PULSE

&gt;AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. said Tuesday it is buying 22% of Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. and its 71,000 acre Hycroft Mine in Northern Nevada, that is understood to have 15 million ounces of gold deposits and some 600 million ounces of silver deposit. The company will also receive 23.4 million warrants priced at a discount of $1.07 a share. Hycroft shares closed Monday at $1.37. Eric Sprott, a metals investor, will make an investment equal to AMC, the company said in a statement. Combined, the investment comes to $56 million, giving Hycroft financial runway. "To state the obvious, one would not normally think that a movie theatre company's core competency includes gold or silver mining," AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron said in the statement. He cited AMC's success in recent years in guiding through a period of severe liquidity challenge, strengthening its balance sheet and communicating with retail investors as experience it can bring to Hycroft, which has seen its share price hurt by its own liquidity challenges. The investment "is a truly terrific opportunity to potentially strengthen and enrich our company, and thereby create significant value for AMC Entertainment shareholders," he said. AMC shares were up 0.4% premarket but have lost 50% of their value in the year to date as the "meme" stock trade has faded. Hycroft shares jumped 48% premarket and are down 79% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 5%.NOTICE: WE DO NOT SELL THINGS HERE.

Thank you.JP Morgan loses another 1.36 million oz of silver defending fiat now up to 17.1 million oz during the March Madness contract. Delivery notices come at least 4 days after initiating the short position ... and what does that mean?Play it  again Sam...

https://preview.redd.it/tldjgsihvln81.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8993950edf2e53248d967b9977066b0fd7b6374

JP Morgan transfers 1.39 million oz of silver from eligible to registered. And we all know what happens next ... they issue (sell) 272 contracts (1.36 million oz).

Yesterday's net new contracts was only 2 so obviously JP Morgan initiated these 272 contracts some time back. In fact, the sum total of last 3 days is 137 so they initiated most of these contracts more than 4 days back.

What does that mean? They are dilly dallying issuing delivery notices.

What does that mean? They might not have had the metal and had to acquire it.

It is about certain they don't have *ANY* metal in registered otherwise they'd just issue delivery notices without these repetitive transfers from eligible. Why does it take time to get the metal? Maybe they have to cut a deal with someone to buy it ... 'cause they don't have silver at comex.

\--------------------------------------

EDIT: After reading some comments below ... I'm not saying there isn't any metal in registered. I'm saying that JP Morgan's house account apparently doesn't own any of it. That is almost certain. Furthermore, I'm speculating that they (JP Morgan house account) may not have any eligible silver either ... they are purchasing it as needed to settle their short positions. That is conjecture.

\----------------------------------------

The running total for JP Morgan for this March Madness contract is 17.1 million oz.

Who is on the buying side of these contracts? BofA continues to be the biggest buyer snapping up 96 contracts and this time the CME house account also snapped up 96 contracts.

The open interest after today's delivery notices will be 93 plus/minus any new contracts today. We can hope that JP Morgan's nightmare will have another twist or two over the remaining 2 weeks.

And at the comex vaults ... one truckload OUT OF JP Morgan's VAULT. That's interesting. Probably a customer transfer. Nonetheless ... less metal in that vault is a good thing.

Fairly quiet in gold.

Somehow the Casablanca analog seems appropriate in these war times.$106k Tax BillI'm sending out $106k to the government this week and am pretty happy about it.  

Started last year with $10k in my accounts and was able to get it up to $350k from Jan-Apr.  I cashed out and paid off my house and set money aside for taxes.  All gains were non-GME.

Winners- BAC, PLTR, F, FUBO

Ended up losing $40k from May-Dec, thanks Amazon.  

Losers- AMZN, COIN, BAC, PYPL

Although I'm mostly a lurker, I wanted to thank the WSBOG community for DD, tips, interesting comments, and encouragement.  Seriously couldn't have done it without you.  

Did I learn risk management from losing $40k?  No.  No I did not.  

Here's to 2022!How To Cook Steak For Regards[Finished Product with proof](https://imgur.com/a/qcecTsD) \- I included a card with my username on it because some folks out there like to masquerade as professional chefs.

Last week, [u/modsaregayasfukkk](https://www.reddit.com/u/modsaregayasfukkk/) posted a picture of a recent steak they cooked. It was a noble attempt.

It made me realize a lot of you probably subsist off of expired ramen and care packages your mom sends because she feels bad for you. There's nothing wrong with that.

*However,* cooking is a life skill that is good for things like impressing people you are attracted to, saving money by choosing to eat at home, and general human survival. With WWIII on the way, the last point may be the most important.

This takes literally 15 minutes to make, and the steps are incredibly easy.

1. Buy a steak, thicker the better. The one in the pics is about an inch and a half thick. Much like many of the people active on this sub.
2. BRING IT TO ROOM TEMPERATURE - cooking a steak that is still cold will burn the outside and leave the center raw. Take it out of the fridge and leave it on the counter for two hours.
3. Pat that shit dry with a paper towel - The reason [u/modsaregayasfukkk](https://www.reddit.com/u/modsaregayasfukkk/) struggled with their sear is because their steak wasn't dry enough. Surface should leave no moisture on your finger when you touch it.
4. Season both sides with kosher salt and black pepper. That's it. Don't throw any of your shitty steak seasoning on there. Freshly cracked pepper and a good brand of kosher salt is all you need. I use [Diamond Crystal.](https://www.diamondcrystalsalt.com/kosher-salt)
5. Get your pan ripping hot. If your pan isn't hot enough, you miss out on the natural browning brought forth by the [maillard reaction.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) Pan should be smoking lightly when you throw your meat on there.
6. Sear the first side for 2.5 - 3 minutes. Just leave it in the pan. Do not touch your meat. Turn it over, sear the other side for 2 minutes. Do not touch your meat.
7. Take it off heat, throw in a tablespoon of butter. Let the butter melt and baste the steak with your melted butter.
8. Remove your meat from the pan, let it rest for 10 minutes. DO NOT CUT INTO it until 10 minutes are up. Resting allows for all the juice in your meat to reabsorb into it. Making it moist and melty in your mouth.
9. Enjoy your home-made steak that you made for $15-$20 that you would have paid triple for at some shitty steak house. Garnish with dijon mustard, horseradish, or whatever other steak garnish you like.Ban Bet: Im bored and the market isnt getting me hard anymoreBAN BET: if Im wrong about my prediction perma ban me. Give me a margin of error of -+20$ for each target.

SPX next week will retest 4395 resistance to which it will reject. In over a week or two we will fall down to the bottom before the last rally up to either a new ath or a double top. Bottom is 3930 (leaning towards bottom this week - leaning towards ath)

The risk taking in the market just doesnt get me hard anymore so Ill start taking more risky bets here. If I live this Ill give a comprehensive guide as to how I know where we're going.

TLDR: 

SPX RETEST 4395 AND REJECT

SPX BOTTOMS OUT AT 3930

BAN ME IF IM WRONG (MARGIN OF ERROR -+20$)

P.S use the oanda chart

P.S.S screenshot so [no edits](https://imgur.com/a/kQLA5im)Putin has show the use of anon cryptoI think with the threat of instability, war, and authoritarianism more anonymous cryptos show there value.(ex.Monero)

Even though imo the point of crypto is the decentralization of currency, many peoples complaints are it will be used for illegal services. Although this may pose a problem, what if you live in a place where you’re family isn’t safe and don’t want a dictator tracking your movement so they can hunt you down. I’m just worried that one day they will be able to break anon currencies and destroy there value. When NATO sanctioned Russia there was essentially a bank rush. With their values ruined Russian families became trapped in poverty unable to protest. These currencies might offer a way to feed their families or offer an escape to opposing civilians. The two biggest issues I see is that the volatility of the market offers no stability and I am concerned that even though it’s untraceable rn they said that about bitcoin and intelligence agencies definitely can. Idk I’m rambling… what are you alls thoughts?(yes I’m southern)HelloWhat you guys think about the crypo market, would  Bitcoin rise above 45k?, recent months it was going around 38-45 or so, now i am in a losing position because i have invested when etherium 2900 . i think it will rise again so i am not selling my own crypto for now but it would be great to have another peoples opinions also

We were as surprised as you to discover this subreddit blowing up out of nowhere! If you have any genuine feedback on how to improve the sub feel free to share below.Update on Recent Changes to RCPsThe admins recently released a new [documentation](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction) for Community Points that includes changes for all RCPs. Please keep in mind we do not know if these changes are final or if they will be modified in any way before mainnet launch.

# Hardcap Removal

Initially 50 million moons were available for contributors based on their participation prior to the start of the Community Points project. After the initial distribution Round 1 began with 5,000,000 moons released, and the distribution schedule at the time called for a 2.5% drop in new issuance each round. The theoretical supply cap from this model was 250,000,000, however as moons that go unclaimed longer than six months are permanently burned this supply cap would have never been reached.

**The admins have removed the 250,000,000 hardcap and instead have opted for new issuance to drop 2.5% each round until Moons reach an annual inflation rate of 1% for total supply:**

[Inflation Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/wmu91rr7ikn81.png?width=1640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d20c17bffbdec958b017e8e85cea0fbe2884e58)

&amp;#x200B;

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/distribution-process)

Based on our estimates Moons are expected to reach 1% annual inflation \~10 years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Burned Moons

As stated above Moons that go unclaimed longer than six months are considered permanently burned, however this is not the case for Moons that are burned when buying the special membership or Reddit coins. Half of Moons spent through these methods in a round are permanently burned and the other half are reserved to be reintroduced in the following round:

[Reintroduction of Burned Moons](https://preview.redd.it/ipxv1qlbikn81.png?width=1568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=269337da34ca3d378a7fbb13d2053bdcb420d4dc)

&amp;#x200B;

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/distribution-process)

There was a bug discovered by u/IHaventEvenGotADog that prevented these burned moons from being reintroduced. The admins have stated that all of the moons burned from rounds 1-22 from both contributors and the Community Tank were permanently burned, and only going forward will 50% be reintroduced.

&amp;#x200B;

# Special Membership Price

Due to [CCIP - 025](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s8dq31/ccip025_algorithmic_moons_pricing_for_reddit/) the special membership price in Moons has been dropped from 1,000 to 100:

[New Membership Price](https://preview.redd.it/5f5n21neikn81.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c604a86bbbf9327cfd5809ad73c25a61b0e18fb1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the recent drop in membership price to 100 Moons and historical membership purchases we expect \~25 - 50k Moons to be reintroduced for contributors each round.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reddit’s Share

Originally the distribution was divided as follows: 50% for contributors, 20% for Reddit, 20% for Community Fund and 10% for moderators. Reddit has since combined their share with the Community Fund and dubbed it the “Community Tank”:

[Creation of Community Tank](https://preview.redd.it/8hyld9vgikn81.png?width=1134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a92d35bf9723caa7220c1ee66943aacdb0ef4a6)

&amp;#x200B;

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/distribution-process)

&amp;#x200B;

# Upcoming Changes

&amp;#x200B;

\- As of tomorrow (3/16) posts or comments that are removed by users will no longer be eligible for Moon distribution.

\- By Round 25 distribution the Decision Threshold will be calculated as a percentage of Moons that are eligible to vote rather than the total supply. What the percentage will be and whether it remains dynamic based on voting participation is unknown at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Terms of Use

&amp;#x200B;

Users have asked why these changes were made without a governance proposal, and the answer is that the admins are allowed to make changes at their discretion per the  [Terms of Use](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms):

*"Reddit does not guarantee that Community Points will continually be offered or will be available for any particular length of time. Reddit may modify Community Points, at its sole discretion, and those modifications may remove or add functionality.

Thank you for reading, please feel free to leave your feedback on these changes and we will do our best to forward it on to the admins. If you have any questions we will be hosting a reddit talk in a few hours to cover these topics.I worked for a crypto start-up for two months. It was horrible.A few months ago, I wrote on this sub that my objective for 2022 was getting a job in crypto. It worked : I got hired for a start-up in December, and started to work for them in January. I resigned a few weeks ago, and now I want to share my (not so good) story with you.

(I won't name the company in question, because I have signed a NDA. But rest assured : you never heard of it before, and it's not a major player in the ecosystem - it's not even a minor player.)

First of all, **the level of disorganisation and chaos was absolute madness**. Each morning we had a different objective, based on the most recent trend in the market. NFTs are becoming popular? Let's do NFTs! This particular token is performing well? Let's buy it, even if it's at ATH! One of our product doesn't work anymore because we rushed a bug-fixing patch? Let's pretend that never happened and let's keep pushing rosy marketing articles!

I know that start-ups are notoriously disorganised. I get it. But you can't expect to be a profitable company, or even be a productive member of the crypto ecosystem, if you can't even define your objectives and stick to it.

Secondly, **we cheated.** What I mean is that we bought bots for our TG channels, we faked users in our Discord, and we partenered with dubious "influencers" to make it look like our products were far more popular than they really were. This kind of stuff is what gives crypto it's bad reputation to the outside world, and I deeply regret having been a part of this for a short time.

And finally, and I think this is the most important part : **the founders didn't care about the crypto ecosystem at all**. Their main objective was making as much money as quickly as possible. We were acting like an evil hedge fund, precisely the type of institution crypto is supposed to fight. 

I felt sad. I felt like a scammer. So I quitted. And, keeping in line with everything I wrote before, **they didn't pay me for my last week of work**. They just ghosted me.

So... yeah. 

I don't want to discourage people from getting a job in crypto. I still believe in the future of this industry. **But I would advise to stick with the well-known companies of our ecosystem**, and not waste your time in little-known start-ups that have big dreams, but can't deliver. We have a long, very long way to go before we become a respectable industry.I’m going to apply to as many crypto jobs as possible and will report back in a months timeLast year LinkedIn saw a flood of job postings involving cryptocurrency, start ups, and Blockchain technology. I [wrote a post about the weirdest crypto jobs available](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s61tdr/we_all_heard_that_demand_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).             

I am finally going to dedicate a few hours each day applying to as many as possible. I am only looking for ones that can be done remotely and pay actual wages, be it in fiat or crypto.            

I will be systematic about it, like I am for all of my job hunts, Excel sheets and all, reporting date applied and the type of replies I get back. I plan to report back in a month or so. Wish me luck, and I’m open to advice from anyone who’s worked in the sector before!Reminder: Vitalik is also sending test transaction before sending a full ammount. One of us.&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ddnnfcsgiin81.png?width=1882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36b713678b7cdd5c1c7f7f1abae5ea1023954d0a

Just one small reminder from the post I found on ethereum subreddit.

Sending crypto can be scary sometimes. That is why, usually, a lot of us send a test transaction first to make sure everything is okay before sending a full ammount.

Now some pros lost that fear with time, but here you can see **one of the biggest crypto masterminds** Vitalik Buterin sending test transaction before sending a full ammount of ETH, just like us!

Well, this transaction also shows how ETH is actually decentralized because we can see network founder is testing transactions because even he knows that he won't take it back if he messes it up.The Merge (ETH 2.0) succesfully happened on the Kiln testnet!The kiln test network succesfully applied the merge and blocks are succesfully being validated.

Of course, issues are definitely to be expected with this merge test, but it definitely shows that we are getting closer and closer to the real thing happening on main net!

So far only one minor issue -  "minor issue with 1 client combination, currently investigating. Block explorer is lagging but the chain is progressing fine" -source [https://twitter.com/dapplion/status/1503758669909045263](https://twitter.com/dapplion/status/1503758669909045263)Anyone else just completely dead to the idea of any new coin that enters the market now?I used to be excited a few years back at the prospect of new coins and their possibilities. Each new entry was a potential chance to get in on the ground level of some new venture into the unknown.

Yet nowadays crypto looks like Netflix, for every actually well known, successful piece of media it's just pages and pages of 'originals' to the point where the little notification that Netflix has released a new item fills me with the same level of excitement as the cooking instructions on my tin of soup.

Every new coin just seems to be either one of the following categories:

1. A rug pull or some other type of scam, often pumped by some influencer or celebrity that will be dead before it even hit the ground.
2. Promise the moon but will never go beyond initial development, often involving laser eyes with a price history that will resemble a playground slide as it creates a perfect first half of a parabola.
3. Some tokenomitry that is just pure maths cringe with about two dozen zeros to the right of the period before you hit an actual number and a supply that extends another couple of down zeros to the left.
4. Elon Dodge trash tier coin

Personally, I'm not even looking at anything that isn't in the top spots anymore, and almost half of those are rejects anyway. It's sad that the discovery phase of crypto is basically dead and it's now just stick to what exists and be a bag holder.Malware that steals your crypto. Reminder to stay awareDue to malware on their computer, one unlucky Bitcoin user was fooled out of 0.255 BTC, roughly $10,000. On Twitter,crypto enthusiast and tech blogger Louis Nel raised the problem, referring to his buddy as 'C.' A friend transferred 0.255BTC to an exchange from his bitcoin wallet. On his PC, he copy pasted the wallet address to avoid any error. When the coins did not arrive at the exchange after 4 hours, he became concerned... 


The Bitcoins were transmitted from Kraken to VALR, a South African exchange," but the malware on his computer captured replaced the wallet address when he pasted it without realizing it. 


The wallet address does not belong to the Kraken exchange who also noted that there are 9 transactions into that wallet, indicating others have been tricked as well. The money at the bitcoin address in question have not changed and currently have a value of 0.27 BTC. 

This should be a reminder to us investors to take our online security very seriously, and invest in trusted projects that have been out there for a while and offer real life purpose, like SocialGood for cryptoback on online purchases, ethereum since it offers the best blockchain for smart contracts, Aave to lend your stablecoins and any other project you find worth your investment.Nervos Network (CKB) full market analysis (D.Y.O.R) ...

FTX Europe, the newly established European unit of crypto exchange FTX, became the first firm to receive a license to operate a crypto exchange and trading house in Dubai.




With the license the exchange will be able to trial crypto derivatives for institutional investors. The license comes a week after Dubai announced the creation of Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), which will be responsible for governing the crypto sector.

The independent authority will "oversee the development of the best business environment in the world for virtual assets in terms of regulation, licensing, governance, and in line with local and global financial systems," Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum tweeted when the news came out.

“FTX receiving this approval is a continuation of our mission to be at the forefront of licensing and regulation around the world,” FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried said in a press release on Tuesday.



Earlier this week, FTX’s rival Binance received a license to operate in Bahrain effectively expanding its middle eastern presence. Binance is also reported to be in talks to obtain a Dubai license.

Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s supply is becoming increasingly illiquid. If this continues, a sell-side liquidity crisis is forming that could send BTC’s price skyrocketing. These are the foundations of the next bull market forming right in front of us. 

Fundamentals are strong and the sentiment is down, which are long-term bullish indicators. Short-term price action (4H) looks bearish, while daily looks bullish and weekly looks neutral/bullish. Bitcoin can continue consolidating, possibly wicking down to low supports before bouncing back into consolidation zone.

https://pokemonio.com/Which DeFi coin do you use?In the last few years, tokens that help power decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols have become increasingly popular. DeFi tokens enable crypto users with access to a variety of bank-like services such as loans, lending, and insurance, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept.  


DeFi tokens are a collection of coins that are native to automated, decentralized networks that use smart contracts to function. These provide customers access to a suite of blockchain-based financial applications and services, as well as $75 billion worth of cryptocurrency.  


We have for example LUNA which is the largest DeFi token, with a market cap of $34.3 billion. It’s the native currency of the Terra network, where it’s used to collateralize mechanisms that back Terra’s algorithmic stablecoins, such as U.S. dollar-pegged TerraUSD (UST).  


As for me, I use the KAIBA token, which is a native Ethereum token, containing the next-generation technology of Kaiba DeFI, and swapping KAIBA in existing DEXs yields up to 40% less in gas fees. While this utility exists in the token in and of itself, holding KAIBA will provide access and use-cases for the Kaiba DeFi ecosystem’s present and future products.  


There are so many tokens we could use such as AAVE, SNX, YFI, UNI, SUSHI and so on and on. Which one do you use?Vallhund Inu - 74k mc | Dashboard + C&amp;C | USDC Rewards | 18,3 BNB Buyback | Trusted + Doxxed | P2E | Staking | Climate + Humanitarian FocusWould Elona win against PUTINA?

Mates, don’t you agree that there are not so many tools of crypto-popularization? Of course almost everybody knows or heard something once about it, but there are not enough instruments to attract people risking and revealing new things for themselves. I am convinced that free tournaments among traders could be a really good attempt.   
I know that none of the people who hear about crypto for the first time won’t even think about wasting money in such contests. But! I faced some really free to enter tournaments which are open for everyone who desires from humsters to pro.  There are no limits and real prize pools. It i s enough to make one operation t5o be an active participant through the tournament to get your free 50 dollars for taking part in, isn’t it a freebie for your experience? No doubt, yes. All is needed to connect your account on Binance through the LOT.TRADE system and get started.   
LOT.TRADE have recently supplied limited NFTs of different types which will give an access to earning even without participating. Wish u didn’t miss your chance, people. It is not a shill, just advice.Best investment club Goldfnigr gon launch their tokens 

We depend on a diverse variety of crypto-ecosystems on a daily basis. To be really honest, it's hard to go from one website to another in order to gain information, do study, and attempt to generate money while you're waiting for the next chance to present itself. With our job and our efforts, we invest our time, the most important resource we have at our disposal. All of their wishes will be granted to those who are patient and take their time with their beverages.

For individuals who are unsure of where to begin or which investments to make, it is recommended that they seek the guidance of a financial expert. Asking for and taking guidance should not be a source of humiliation or fear for anybody. Instead of waiting any longer, why not experiment with artificial intelligence? No, I'm not making light of the situation. Already, via the use of aggregators and standards, disruption-inducing approaches have been made more manageable. Consider the character of Goldfingr. It is possible to get all of the features of a standard investing platform from a single location. Furthermore, the GFT token allows you to make all of your decisions from a single app, which is convenient. It has certain characteristics of social networking sites, but it is designed specifically for traders and investors. The fact that it is no longer unique does not diminish the fact that it was among the first.

It's possible to manage your investments while also communicating with colleagues and watching broadcasts from well-known investors, all from the same deApp. In the following two weeks, the token sale is planned to commence, and we will be able to either observe or participate in it, depending on our interests and availability.Gravis Finance - Unique ecosystem that unites DeFi with Gmart NFT marketplaceDAO backed by Real Life AssetsHi Guys,

[https://www.kxan.com/investigations/tired-of-spam-calls-a-texas-dad-is-fighting-back-by-suing/](https://www.kxan.com/investigations/tired-of-spam-calls-a-texas-dad-is-fighting-back-by-suing/)Looking for advice on starting a side business: thinking of buying land + building prefab cabin for Airbnb. Is this more advantageous than buying something pre-existing?I've been mulling this idea for a while now because I haven't seen anyone take this angle, which makes me think I could pull it off with enough grit since it's a bit of a niche. The idea is to rent Airbnbs in popular outdoorsy mountain towns, but rather than buy &amp; remodel a pre-existing building like most do I would buy land &amp; build prefab trendy cabins that market well to outdoor enthusiasts and trendy Instagrammers alike. I think this could keep cost of entry &amp; maintenance lower while keeping demand &amp; pricing higher and thus pretty good likely profits, assuming I can get things built and running. Additionally this would align with my interests and expertise (at later stages) while taking an approach that many vacation rentals don’t, thus giving me an advantage.

I want to be fully cognizant of the upside potential as well as risks, so below is my pro/con list that I would greatly appreciate feedback on:

**Pros**

1. The home would be newer than anything on the market, and I could also build it with details &amp; amenities that Airbnb guests look for rather than have to force them into an older home
2. A new home would mean less maintenance, at least in the first few years and assuming it’s built right
3. I could pick a design that is immediately trendy and appealing (in this case, A-frame cabins with lots of light), thus improving how much I could charge and decreasing vacancy
4. Because I’m taking the harder route of buying land, there is less buying competition in a hot market
5. Assuming I could get loans either way, the absolute cost of land + prefab is less than buying a pre-existing house + property
6. I have been Airbnb-ing in places like this a lot the last few years, so I have a strong understanding of what renters want, what makes a great experience, what can set a place apart, etc.
7. Though admittedly this isn’t what I should be making business decisions on, I would personally be more motivated because this is in line with my interests (outdoor sports, vacation) and therefore I’d be more interested in the project - plus I would have some beneficial tax write-offs
8. My professional background is in marketing, so once it’s built &amp; ready I know I could manage it well

**Cons**

1. I don't know anything about land buying and have only ever bought a home once, so there will be a learning curve
2. Similarly, I haven't built anything from scratch yet - though I did fully remodel a home last year with a GC &amp; designer, so I’m not entirely ignorant of the challenges that can come with it
3. I can’t bankroll it all up front, which would mean I would need a loan, likely from a bank. Because this is less traditional than a standard 2nd home purchase, I’m not sure how hard this would be. Would it be a builder’s mortgage? An SBA loan? Regardless, if I presented a well-thought out business &amp; building plan I would think I could convince them to do some sort of mortgage &amp; business loan combo.
4. Significant time involved between whenever I get funding and when I actually start earning revenue, so I would have to make payments out of savings for a while
5. General challenges of upkeep, time spent, etc. - though these are all pretty well known with home building &amp; running Airbnbs, plenty of knowledge out there
6. I would still have my full-time job, which can be varying amounts of demand, and although (pro) it is remote, (con) is that I wouldn’t always be able to be on-site during building process
7. The build phase would be limited by weather conditions/seasonality given that I’m looking in mountain towns in the Northeast (likely VT or NH to start)

Here’s the breakdown of what I think I would need to do process-wise - again, please chime in with anything you think is missing:

1. **Research phase:** I would look at popular Airbnb areas - in my case mountain towns, since that's the market I know best - and do my due diligence in terms of vacancy rates, profitability (using Mashvisor), etc. Once I've identified a place that looks good on paper I would visit it, make sure it's a place I would actually want to vacation, start looking at sites, and do all the in-person DD. I already have a decent idea of good locations for this approach, given that’s what I’ve been doing for vacations and weekend getaways the last few years.
2. **Buying phase:** I would then look for land for sale in the area that has good potential for Airbnb rentability (no HOA, short-term rental-friendly town, near good amenities, etc.) and do my due diligence there. This is where I am admittedly weakest as I have never bought purely land, so I would need to learn a lot to make sure I do the right surveying and all that. This is also where my biggest question comes into play: I wouldn't be able to front the cost, and I know banks are hesitant to loan money for land in the first place and builder's loans require a lot of extra work because the bank wants to see exact plans, cost estimates, etc. But I think with a strong enough business plan I could negotiate (likely with a local bank or credit union) some sort of land purchase + prefab materials &amp; labor = business loan. What are your thoughts there?
3. **Building phase:** Here is where I could save some costs and also stand out from the crowd. Because I am looking at mountain towns with a healthy winter + summer demand, and because A-frames - even small ones - are very trendy right now (especially with the Instagram crowd), I could build a comfy cabin for much cheaper than a standard home build. It would also have the benefit of having many plans and costs already estimated up-front, which could help with bank loans. I recognize I would still need to find good, qualified labor and that the process of building a home is a nightmare (especially during COVID), but I feel more confident that I could weather that since I just completed a full year-long house renovation so I've at least gotten my feet wet with what construction is like currently. Of course I recognize I can always learn more and there will be curveballs, but I'm not going in blind.
4. **Renting phase:** This is where all the little details would come in with decorating, listing online, making sure I have nearby handypeople, making it a welcoming place and not just an Ikea catalog, and all that. Here is where my skills are strongest because I'm a marketer by profession so I know I could create a great listing and would also automate as much as possible using Vacasa or Evolve; additionally I have been renting Airbnbs in the nearby target areas tons (as well as similar towns on the West coast), so I have a really good sense of what makes a great Airbnb that people of varied backgrounds would want to rent and pay well for.

**Other notes -** beyond everything listed above, I have some other thoughts and questions I’d love input on:

1. Does it make sense to establish a business and do it via an LLC (or similar) from the start, or should I do that later?
2. There must be a reason I don’t see this done more - is it simply because housing stock is decent enough that people would rather convert what exists? Or is it far more work than I’m anticipating? Or something else?
3. Most importantly, is this a potentially good side-business or am I letting my desire to make money off my vacation interests cloud my judgment?

Thanks in advance for any advice &amp; feedback!Would anyone pay for social emailing with a family?Hi folks,

I'm looking for feedback on a little idea that I have for a side business.

My wife and I live in Australia and have a toddler (boy) and another baby (girl) on the way. We visited the USA in 2019 when our toddler was only 5 weeks old and loved it. We met so many lovely people and it made me realise how a lot of older people are so interested in families with young kids.

My wife will be taking time off work when the new baby comes, and I've been trying to think of a way that we could earn an additional income stream from home

One idea that I have is to set up a membership site that is all about us and our growing family. We'd post daily updates. But the key aspect of the service is that we would engage in ongoing email communication with our customers. We would commit to always replying within 24 hours to emails, that would update people about our lives, our kids, share photos and videos, and respond to whatever the member has said to us. We wouldn't be looking to get a huge number of members, and would have time to properly read and respond to all emails.

My wife thinks that no-one would pay for is. What do you guys think?

I'm thinking the target market for this would probably be older women who love to be in the loop with younger people and kids. I'd use ticketing software to keep track of the emails, speed up replies, track reply times etc.

In my mind, it would be a form of entertainment like a magazine subscription. I'm confident that the service would provide a lot of value to members. But I'm not sure if it's too much of a psychological barrier to actually exchange money for this sort of service.

Feedback welcome!Cafe IdeaNew Age Business to Reward Every EmployeeHello everyone,

Not even sure if this is the right sub but I literally just came up with this idea, well the math of this. Plumbing and lots of other trades are extremely. Lucrative. I have worked for a few companies and the exploitation is bad. I started my own company about 6 months ago and am doing very well but am trying to ethically hire a workforce. 

I am going to lay out some dumb math and let’s see if anyone has any feedback for me. I have done it large scale and small scale and it seems to add up. 

Example 1: Large Plumbing Corp (Based on a company I worked for): 
- Revenue - 65,000,000
- Employees - 210 
- I estimate profit to be around 15 million (Conservatively) 

If profit sharing and equal pay across the board was enacted it seems that this would be the math for example:

(Base Salary) 85,000 x (Payroll Taxes, Expenses) 3 x (Amount of employees) 210 = 53,550,000

Subtract that from the yearly revenue and you’d get 10,450,000 which would then be split evenly among everyone if they all worked equal time (so you get profit sharing daily) that would be an extra 50k for each employee each year. 

Let’s scale this down to a company of 5. I’d say on average in plumbing you can generate 45k per month per truck in my area. So let’s say this company has 3 trucks a manager and a phone person. Everyone still makes 85k a year. 

$85,000 x 3 x 5 = $1,275,000

$45,000 x 12 months x 3 Trucks = $1,620,000

($1,620,000 - $1,275,000) / 5 employees = $69,000 per year for each employee on top of that 85k base. 

Thank you to anyone who actually read all this! Let me know what y’all think. Idk if I’m just really high or this is how I should build my business.Business Idea Help and researchHi Reddit!

I'm an mechanical engineer with 5 years of experience in my late 20's. I have been working right after graduating college in silicon valley in a fortunate 500 company and would like to branch out and jump start my own business. The only problem is planning what I want to do. I've been researching for a couple of months and nothing seem intriguing to me. I have experience in sheet metal and plastic products and have thought about going into it but the only issue is the overhead cost is extremely high (100k+).

I want some help and guidance on where i should start. If I can get some helps with websites/links/dioscord/etc... that would be extremely helpful. Thanks Reddit!!Gaming console arcadePretty much self explanatory but if I were to charge someone $10 to play on an Xbox I have set up somewhere, how could I charge them without having to be there?Phone call software for insurance agentsHi, I’m thinking of a software (it will come with an app) that can reduce the time needed for a phone call, by almost removing the time needed for entering of the number. Of course it will save just a few second per call but if an insurance agent makes 200 calls a day this can save a few hours a month, that are now wasted on just entering numbers. 
It will then optimize the management (import and export) of list of names, as well as the functionality to insert the phone call results (answered, not answered, interested, etc).

From what i can see this operation (in Italy) is still made using lists on paper and/or excel files.

      I am have recently been accepted into Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst as well as Bentley University.

I am Shantanu, founder, and consultant at MBA &amp; Beyond. We are starting a long-term initiative for women applicants at MBA &amp; B and wanted to talk about it with you all. A few days ago, I was going through the stories of a woman applicant when I realized the professional and societal biases women go through.

And that is why, this women's day, we want to empower women applicants and help them lead to their dream business school in any way we can possibly do.

**A little about the session-** It is kind of a chat show format to make it fun and interactive. All the [women who made it to the Top 10 Business Schools](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBAandBeyond/) with MBA &amp; Beyond will be sharing their application journeys, the challenges they faced, and the most pressing concerns women applicants have. This is ideal for all women applicants who are targeting MBA, MiM, Deferred MBA or any other masters program. At the end of the session, some of the women from the audience will get the opportunity to talk to our speakers on a one-on-one call to discuss their application concerns.

Since we do not want to disturb the ongoing discussions in this community, we will be sharing all the details of the session, the topics of the session, and speakers on this community- [https://www.reddit.com/r/MBAandBeyond/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBAandBeyond/)

Also, feel free to ask any questions you may have about applications and we'd try to add them to the session as well!

\- I want to end up in an english speaking country like London or Dubai so technically Imperial is better.

\- But schools in London don't have a good placement record, even LBS students I know didn't get jobs in London so I'm not sure about Imperial's reputation. 

\- ESCP and ESSEC are two year courses which are a disadvantage as well as an advantage. Disadvantage in the sense that you will not be able to work full time till the next two years and advantage because there will be more internship and employment opportunities.

Please guide me!Posts regarding politicsMany of you know, we have a strict no-politics rule on this subreddit. It's explicitly stated in the rules.

For a while now we've been temp/perma banning people for breaking said rule.

Effective immediately, any and *all* posts regarding politics, no matter how relevant, will result in an immediate 4 week ban. You may appeal this if it happens to you. But it's pretty straight forward. 

We will no longer perma-ban first time offenders but multiple offenders will be perma banned, including those who post multiple politically fueled posts in one sitting before we catch it the first time. 

Covid-19's affect on business is not included in this.

Just remember, r/business is a pro-business subreddit. We hold the right to remove anti-business propaganda, and bad company behavior belongs over at r/greed, not here. We will not ban people for these posts, however.Describe what you do in as few words as possible?Curious to learn about the things people do. Thanks in advance.If you have a thousand bucks. what would you invest in?Hi, my friends. I wanna share with you guys my all experience. 

I have 3 years of experience trading stock and crypto, or buying real estate and selling them. 

\- point of my view is those investments, I think trading crypto is the best gain your profit in a short time and it will change your life, but you should care about the risk, highly volatile and high profit. if you are lucky maybe you can rich with them. 

\- trading stock is good too. but the profit is very low, the risk makes sense, and gold is growing price every year. 

\- Real estate is a very hard and tiring task depending on who the client is and very tricky.Work for a very old fashioned/conservative investment bank. Permissions and Access to data is a constant issue and slows us down considerably. Any advice?Pretty much as the title says. They have a historically very underfunded IT department and are only now modernizing various things. Everything is on prem, forget the cloud.

I need permission to do anything on this job. Simple pip install updates for pandas for instance I get blocked and access denied in writing to my anaconda file on c drive. Need to send an email to an IT person who will do it, takes an hour sometimes.

Getting read access to a simple database to simply pull data with select - where statements can take 2-3 weeks depending on circumstances.

I have been thinking of this recently because I have a friend who is a real estate agent that pays Zillow a ridiculous amount of money to use their product. The company that she works for does not provide the service for her to use and in turn she has to pay for the product on a monthly basis.

Tampa isn’t exactly HCOL, but the cost of living has been rising the past few years and it has been hit hard with inflation recently (~10% as of Feb).

Feedback WantedI’m participating in a competition where we pitch for 3 minutes a business idea that we have (with a 5 minute Q&amp;A Session)

I’d like some feedback on my pitch and idea as well as questions you’d ask if you were a judge/potential investor.

Below the pitch I’ll post some commonly asked questions (and answers to them) as well

Here’s the pitch:

Imagine a world where we could charge our phones anytime, anywhere, and anyplace..without having to make sure to remember to bring a cord or portable charger wherever you go, especially since they can be very easily forgotten or misplaced. 

Our idea makes this dream scenario into reality…Now you’ll never have to worry about bringing or finding a charger for your phone again… 

The wireless charging market is currently valued at around 12 Billion Dollars, and expected to increase to 185 Billion Dollars by 2030.  We plan to take this industry by storm.

Our idea is a clothing line that allows you to wirelessly charge your devices in your pocket using solar and kinetic energy… Just slip your phone in your pocket and let it charge!
 
 
How it works is that we use ultra-thin-film batteries, powered by solar cells integrated into the clothing fabric, which harnesses and stores solar and artificial light, that are connected to a wireless charging pad in your pocket in order to wirelessly charge your device in less than 3 hours.
 
We would also use “piezoelectric textiles”, which is embedded into the clothing, powered by a thin and small piezoelectric disc that provides power to the device being charged when you walk or move while wearing the clothes.
 
All electrical components would be covered by thermo-regulating fabric to prevent the device and battery from heating up too much or being affected by the cold as well.
 
All electrical components would also be covered with waterproof fabric to prevent any potential electrical hazards from occurring, so you can be rest assured you won’t be lighting up like a Christmas tree 
 
If it rains outside and it won’t cause any damage and if you wash or dry clean them it won’t cause damage either, although we recommend using cold water and a garment bag that would come with each of our products to wash.
 
Our target market is Upper Middle Class (and higher) Gen Z, Millennials, and Gen X’s that can be avid travelers, non remote workforce professionals, as well as High School and College Students
 
We also plan to secure a utility patent for this idea and then aim to receive a 10% royalty of every sale to whatever company we license it out to. 
 
We would aim to license this product to Mid-Large Sized fashion companies and retailers with a strong focus on Innovation, Growth, and that sell to our target audience. Examples of these companies are: Nike, Ralph Lauren, Athleta, Lululemon, North Face, etc
 
Thank you for taking the time to watch our pitch, do you have any questions?

Here are some questions people commonly ask:

Q: Why would I buy this if I can just buy a portable charger that’s much cheaper.

A: Portable chargers can easily become useless if you forget (and you probably will) it if you’re busy or rushing. Our product eliminates this possibility and justifies the cost by making this process much more efficient by allowing you to charge your device in your pocket. Plus I doubt you leave the house without your pants…right?


Q: How does the solar aspect work?

A:  So typically how solar panels work is that they are powered by “solar cells”, which are devices embedded into the glass/plastic that’s being used for the solar panel. Recently in early 2020 Scientists in Finland have created solar cells that are small enough to be woven and combined into any sort of Fabric, which opened up the possibility for our product to be solar-powered and not look like they have solar panels on them at all. They look and feel exactly like normal clothing.


Q: How does the Kinetic fabric work?

A: In 2018 a research team from Sweden created “Piezoelectric textiles”, which is able to create energy when the fabric is stretched &amp; moved. The fabric is able to be woven and combined into any sort of fabric.


Q: How much does the clothing cost to produce?

A: It depends on which garment is being produced. The average production cost is around $39.95 per garment, although we recommend a 100% price increase of the sale product compared to the production cost. To justify the higher cost, is why we target this product towards upper middle class and overall wealthier people, who can afford it.Is it easy to learn Tableau if you know Power BI already?Basically the title.

Curious on some thoughts on a table structure I’m dealing with. 

Basically I have a series of sites that generate flow values. Each site will either represent an input or an output from an area. So the total amount for an area at a given time is the input minus output. 

What I’m stuck on is the representation of the relationship. 

In the example below site A leaves zone 1 to zone 2. Site B is only input to Zone1. For 12 pm it should be 5 for Zone1 and 10 for Zone2. 

Given the subtraction, would you duplicate the fact row for every output and set it to a negative. This would simplify the calculations and have it simply as a sum. The relation would be a key for the site in zone 1 and 2. Downside is you’re basically doubling the fact size (talking tens of millions easily)

Option B is 1 fact row and somehow add an input and output dim I guess?

Fact
Time | Site | Value
12:00 | A | 10
12:00 | B | 15
12:10 | A | 5
12:10 | B | 10

Areas
Site | Zone 
A | Zone1 | Out
A | Zone2 | In
B | Zone1 | In


There is probably 30 zones in total, each site only has one in and out though, so a max of 2x fact rows. 

Thoughts?

One more point is the sites are used for other facts. So duplicating an input and output wouldn’t make sense. There wouldn’t be a logical one to attach to.Business Intelligence Analyst Salaries in MaltaModpost: Why is my post/comment getting removed?Hi All. 

I wanted to give everyone a peek behind the curtain on what it's like to moderate this subreddit as well as create a refernce point to explain to folks why our automoderator removes their posts immediately. 

Off the top of my head, I would estimate that close to 80% of the "content" submitted here is spam. When I created the subreddit, I was naive to the fact that having the word "business" in the title of the subreddit would attract spam bots and obnoxious wannabe entrepreneurs. The best tool that I have to keep the subreddit clean is to have automod remove posts from new accounts and acccounts with low karma. I just don't have the time to clean up all the garbage that gets posted and maintain the (admittedly low to middling) quality of the subreddit unless I let automod do the dirty work. 

So if your post was appropriate for our subreddit and got removed by automod, please sit tight and I will manually approve your post/comment when I am next on. If anyone has any questions, please post them below.

bigshot937Jewelry shop breaks watch tries to blame me and cusses me out!**TLDR** Went to sketchy mall jewelry shop, cracked the crystal and bent the back cover. When I  went to pick it up they said that's how I brought it in!

\-

I felt bad that I never wore the $300 watch my brother gave me for Christmas a few years back.  I'm not really a watch guy. The battery died so I decided to get it replaced so I could wear it during the holidays when he was in town. That way he knows I appreciate it.

Against my better judgement I took it to a nearby mall. The mall has been  in decline for the last couple decades, like many across America. The only stores that are left are JC penny, the stores that sell crystals and sketchy jewelry stores. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, and stopped in to what looked like a family owned jewelry shop. 

I asked the guy at the counter, lets call him gary, if he could replace watch battery and he said "yeah no problem" it will be about $30 a piece, it'll be done in about 15 minutes. Its a pretty routine thing to replace a watch battery so no worries right? I thought so too

I go back, the guy looks nervous.

Gary: He says the it wont be ready until the jeweler gets in tomorrow. 

Me: whys that.

Gary: I had trouble getting the back of the case on

Me: Can I see it?

Gary: Sure

I look at it an I'm like "OH FUCK" the back was scratched, and the retaining o-ring was bent. At this point I could tell I had made a mistake coming  in here. I decided to cut my losses, pay for the battery and take it to a family friend's jewelry shop to get it fixed. Again it was a practically new watch. 

When I get back to my car and I notice the crystal was cracked...So I went back in

Me: We got a problem

Gary's manager: Whats the matter

Me: I just came in here to to get a battery replaced and gary broke the crystal and the back is bent

Gary: He brought it in like that

Gary's manager: He says you brought it in like that

Me: I barely wore this watch there's no way! This is a $300 watch!

Gary: That piece of crap watch wasn't $300

At this point I was seeing red. I can deal with people who have an attitude but this guy was lying to my face. After a little more back and forth they told me to come back tomorrow  when  the jeweler was in. I go back  

Jeweler: you see the scratches, this was definitely worn. It mustve already been broken

Me: Your employee made those scratches

Gary: No I didn't he's lying

Jeweler: Its clearly been worn

Me (seeing red again): You aren't listening, I brought it in like new. Tell me what you are going to do to make this right its a $300 dollar watch

Jeweler: Fine we will replace the crystal only but thats it

I get my receipt

Gary: Once you get that piece of crap fixed I don't ever want to see you in here again

Me: don't worry I wouldn't by any of this crap jewelry anyway

Gary: Why don't you get the fuck out

I leave in disblief, the guy is kicking me out after he broke MY stuff. It goes on. I go back to pick it up

Me: Hi I'm here to pick up my watch

Gary's manager: You owe us for the battery

Me: Fine if thats what gets this overwith, whats $15 dollars matter

Gary: Ok now get the fuck out

Me: Why dont you lose some weight. 

Gary: Why don't I fuck you up

Me: This is fucking ridiculous this is the worst fucking store I've ever been in, you guys are fucking clowns

They didn't even put the back on the watch, so i still need to go get it repaired... Im just at a loss. When was younger I would have fought that dude, but I've learned that it isnt gonna solve anything. I want to get back at them but I don't really see any recourse. I feel like filing with the better business bureau or calling the mall is a waste of time.business casual dressHey, I need some opinions.

I just got my first ever office job, starting Monday. It’s a bit more of a casual office, jeans are fine as long as you still look well put together. I’m really not wanting to have to buy new shoes, and I can’t wear my booties with everything. Can I get away with nice open toed heels? Or even the occasional dressy sandal? I see a lot of people incorporating sneakers, like vans or air force ones, into their work wardrobes which I think can still look professional as long as the rest of your outfit pulls it together, so I would think that a nice open-toed shoe would be okay too? But I don’t want to make myself look bad either. For example, I have a pair of suede, open toed, nude block heels that would go perfect with any outfit, very neutral and dressy. Is this a giant faux pas, or just another outdated rule that doesn’t really apply anymore?

I know how to work out the detailed work, it's just the overall planning and putting it in to a cohesive plan. 
 
My employer is going through the process of adopting an ERP system. We are a split company. Half is R&amp;D, sales of physical hardware, marketing and HR. The other half is a contract research lab, which is the the dept I currently work in as a data analyst. 
 
I've worked on a CRM adaptation from concept to production, and worked in a M&amp;A dept. to assimilate incoming companies in to the main database. My current employer has made the jump to introduce an ERP system. I've been positioning my self to be the main contact and intermediary for the CRO and the ERP system; where I would be the person "translating" my department's business processes in to the ERP. 
 
I'm pretty solid in knowing how things should go through the process, but laying out an overall critical path and how deep to explain the overall process, I'm a bit lost on.Looking for feedbackMy co-founders and I have been conducting user research to understand pain points faced by the business analyst &amp; data scientists in their day 2 day jobs. We spoke to 8 users so far from various industries and we are looking to validate our findings outside of our network. We heard 4 broad pain points (not in any particular order):

1. Reproducing work that someone did is painful because of lack of clear documentation
2. Searching for information related to past products is hard (there is lot of info but it is hard to surface the most important).
3. No easy way to document (or save) interim results (codes, method, presentation material)
4. Lack of clear and timely communication of context or assumption changes from management

I am sure there are several other pain points. I would love community's help in validating if the above resonate and how severe the pain is in their jobs, and if you as a individual user or manager of business analysts or data scientists have bigger points to callout."How would you help a stakeholder find a solution to a problem if all they give you is a one sentence request or explanation?"Hi so I had an interview last week for a kind of entry level BA position. One of the questions I was asked was "How would you help a stakeholder find a solution to a problem if all they give you is a one sentence request or explanation?"   

Aside from requirements elicitation, asking stakeholders questions, creating user stories and test cases, I wasn't really sure what else to say. She wanted more info. She said creating a project charter would be another piece of that process. I want to try to answer the rest of it and send it over so I can at least show that I'm able to learn as I go.  

I'm taking some pointers from Lean Six Sigma with the project charter, business case, goal statement, timeline etc. Also referencing a business process template.

Well, here you have it. Just a few days after Jerome and Janete made their rounds in front of congress and the media assuring the US Dollar would retain it's reserve status, we already have news of countries considering leaving it. 

Like clockwork, the opposite of what they say seems to happen a short while after. 

Whether it's about transitory inflation, our dollar's reserve status, or the risk of a recession, it seems they've been off the mark for a while.

At this point market has priced in 25 basis points, however anything more than that would mean Fed and Powell is panicking about sky high inflation of 7.9% and may send the markets crashing.

Additionally, even if the hike is only 25 basis points, its the guidance that will matter the most and if Powell says they are anticipating &gt;5 hikes of 25 basis points this year,  we can expect the market to could go to a tailspin and have same kind of volatility like 2018 all over again and could reach the Jan-Feb 2020 highs for SPY and Dow

Add to that 40 year high inflation of 7.9%, supply chain issues, commodity prices rising and first large war in Europe since WWII. 

Tomorrow could be a very volatile day and Powell has to walk a very fine line.. 
I wonder what  Powell is thinking right now

Saudi Arabia is in active talks with Beijing to price its some of its oil sales to China in yuan, people familiar with the matter said, a move that would dent the U.S. dollar’s dominance of the global petroleum market and mark another [shift by the world’s top crude exporter toward Asia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?mod=article_inline).

The talks with China over yuan-priced oil contracts have been off and on for six years but have accelerated this year as the Saudis have [grown increasingly unhappy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-emirati-leaders-decline-calls-with-biden-during-ukraine-crisis-11646779430?mod=article_inline) with decades-old U.S. security commitments to defend the kingdom, the people said.

The Saudis are angry over the U.S.’s lack of support for their intervention in [the Yemen civil war](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-fight-to-turn-the-tide-in-yemens-civil-war-11647180197?mod=article_inline), and over the Biden administration’s [attempt to strike a deal with Iran](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-nuclear-talks-break-off-without-a-deal-11646997132?mod=article_inline) over its nuclear program. Saudi officials have said they were shocked by the precipitous [U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-u-s-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years-11630355853?mod=article_inline) last year.

China buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China’s currency. The Saudis are also considering including yuan-denominated futures contracts, known as the petroyuan, in the pricing model of [Saudi Arabian Oil Co](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SA/XSAU/2222). , known as Aramco.

It would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of [global oil sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-03-15-2022-11647333255?mod=article_inline)—around 80%—are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom. 

China [introduced yuan-priced oil contracts in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-attempts-to-supplant-dollar-face-historic-difficulties-1522063947?mod=article_inline) as part of its efforts to make its currency tradable across the world, but they haven’t made a dent in the dollar’s dominance of the oil market. For China, using dollars has become a hazard highlighted by U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and on Russia in response to [the Ukraine invasion](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news).

China has stepped up its courtship of the Saudi kingdom. In recent years, China has helped Saudi Arabia [build its own ballistic missiles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-begin-making-ballistic-missiles-with-chinese-help-11640294886?mod=article_inline), consulted on a nuclear program and begun investing in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s pet projects, [such as Neom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-princes-vision-for-neom-a-desert-city-state-tests-his-builders-11619870401?mod=article_inline), a futuristic new city. Saudi Arabia has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [to visit later this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?reflink=mobilewebshare_twitter&amp;mod=article_inline).

Meanwhile the Saudi relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated under President Biden, who said in the 2020 campaign that [the kingdom should be a “pariah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-urged-to-penalize-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-killing-11614546231?mod=article_inline)” for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence authorities say ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, refused to sit in on a call between Mr. Biden and the Saudi ruler, King Salman, last month.

It also comes as the U.S. economic relationship with the Saudis is diminishing. The U.S. is now among the top oil producers in the world. It once imported 2 million barrels of Saudi crude a day in the early 1990s but those numbers have fallen to less than 500,000 barrels a day in December 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By contrast, China’s oil imports have swelled over the last three decades, in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Arabia was China’s top crude supplier in 2021, selling at 1.76 million barrels a day, followed by Russia at 1.6 million barrels a day, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.

“The dynamics have dramatically changed. The U.S. relationship with the Saudis has changed, China is the world’s biggest crude importer and they are offering many lucrative incentives to the kingdom,” said a Saudi official familiar with the talks.

“China has been offering everything you could possibly imagine to the kingdom,” the official said.The current sentiment makes me think stocks might rallyI've been in the market during three significant downturns: dot-com (teenager with a custodial Etrade account), 2008 and 2020.  In all cases, the bottom was when people took worst-case scenarios as given.  They all thought it was obvious things would go lower, and even if they were buyers, they prefaced comments with statements like "I'm just going to keep buying all the way to the bottom."  No one thought things were about to go up.

Somehow, we're at that point right now.  It is somehow clear to everyone that things are bad and are going to get much, much worse.  That sort of sentiment makes me think we are in for a rally.  When markets have been on the edge of an actual cliff before, the prevailing view was things wouldn't get that bad, valuations weren't too crazy, known risks were less serious than some thought, etc.

My view: The economy is stronger than some people believe, we don't have a recession, oil prices won't go as high as some think and the sell off will be viewed as a buying opportunity in retrospect.  There are still some stocks that I think will fall further (no- or low-earnings tech), but significant parts of the market are not particularly expensive relative to earnings, especially when interest rates are accounted for.

Good luck to all.Putin Signs Law Allowing Russian Air Carriers to Seize Western Jets Worth $10Bhttps://www.thedrive.com/news/44754/putin-signs-law-allowing-russian-air-carriers-to-seize-western-jets-worth-10b

**The Russian government wants to allow for the repurposing of more than 500 jets for domestic travel.**

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine now about to enter its third week, cascading impacts across global commerce are cropping up by the day. This trend continued Monday, as state-owned media agency TASS reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed an order allowing for the seizure of over 500 commercial jets that Russian airlines have leased from Western companies. It is an unprecedented move for the global aviation industry.

The law comes after a period where the future of the jets was unclear. With many countries banning flights from Russia, including the entirety of the European Union and the United States, many Western aircraft leasing firms sought to repossess the jets, with the EU providing a March 28 deadline to any European firms to recover their property. Russia's airlines reportedly operate 728 Western-made aircraft in total, and it's believed that 515 aren't owned by these air carriers—instead, they are leased from other companies. The foreign airplanes are primarily made by either Boeing (332 total planes) or Airbus (304 total planes), and both companies have announced they will not be supplying parts or technical support to Russian carriers until further notice. Now, the Russian government has allowed domestic airliners to keep the planes—valued at a cumulative $10 billion dollars—and break lease agreements.

This leads to further logistical problems for Russia's domestic airliners. All planes have to be certified as airworthy by their country of origin, and most of Russia's leased fleet has lost that certification. The planes primarily come from Bermudan and Irish companies, whose governments have already revoked the planes' ability to fly under international law. As a result, the seized planes will not be allowed in international airspace until those certifications are reinstated. The Kremlin is seeking to change Russian airworthiness certification laws to allow for domestic agencies to certify foreign aircraft as safe and worthy for travel, which would allow them to be flown domestically. Without a supply of fresh parts for maintenance and repairs, though, it's unclear how long carriers can keep the planes in the air. 

Even more critically for the country, registering an airplane in two countries at once is not allowed by rules defined by the United Nation's 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, which set international standards for airspace. If Russian airlines decide to take advantage of Putin's new law and seize the jets, re-registering them in Russia, they risk destroying relationships with manufacturers and lessors and may be disallowed from international airspace going forward. If they let the planes sit indefinitely, it could spell financial catastrophe as significant portions of their fleets stay grounded. Aeroflot, Russia's largest air carrier and a state-owned company, has already flown most of its foreign-owned planes back to Russia ostensibly to prevent repossession, but it has not re-registered any of the planes yet. 

It is hard to determine how, exactly, this affects global travel and aviation companies. The Russian breach with decades-old international law hasn't been done before and threatens the very model of the aircraft leasing business, which depends on allowing international owners to repossess unpaid airliners. With that standard upended, even if the invasion is withdrawn and sanctions recede, it could be quite a long time before the dust settles and the fate of the trapped airliners is clear.

**A Lousy Offer from the Start**

"It's a lousy offer coupled to an even worse offer," said last week Eddy Pieniazek, head of analytics and advisory at aviation consultancy, Ishka in the United Kingdom. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the roubles has dropped by roughly 30%. Leasing contracts are valued in US dollars, which is the currency that the leasing business acquires and purchases planes. With Russia expelled from the SWIFT system, hindering its ability to conduct financial transactions, it becomes
increasingly difficult for Russian airlines to make
payments at all.

If contracts are canceled, the Cape Town Convention
requires airlines to return aircraft with little intervention,
which Western sources claimed as of last week was not
happening, despite Russia's insistence that the sanctions
are unjustified.

"Cape Town should be involved, implying a smooth
aircraft recovery operation. What they're proposing is that
all of the aircraft's contracts be broken" Pieniazek
remarked.

**Global Leasing Mass Default**

Sanctions have blocked off Russia's procurement of most aircraft and parts, which forced international flights to be canceled for fear of their aircraft being confiscated by foreign lessors or banks. The sanctions have also frozen a large portion of Russia's foreign reserves, forcing authorities to explore measures to halt withdrawals of foreign cash.

If the dispute threatened the world's biggest mass default for the global leasing business, which possesses over 50% of the world's airliner fleet, the leased aircraft law signed by Putin complicates the situation further. Experts fear the subsequent wave of claims might spark a decade-long court struggle between lessors and insurers over whether or not war-risk insurance will payout.Bloomberg: "AMC teams up with Eric Sprott on mining investment (really)"AMC Entertainment Holdings Corp., which got swept up in last year's meme stock rally, is teaming up with one of Canada's best known mining experts on an investment.

AMC announced Tuesday morning that it's joining with Eric Sprott on investments in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. Each of them will plow US$27.9 million into Hycroft in exchange for a 21.8 per cent stake in the miner.

"To state the obvious, one would not normally think that a movie theatre company’s core competency includes gold or silver mining," said AMC CEO Adam Aron in the release.

He went on to state that AMC's "demonstrated expertise" in navigating liquidity challenges will be beneficial to Hycroft, as the miner seeks to develop a 71,000-acre mine in Nevada.

The investments will see AMC and Sprott acquire 23,408,240 units in Hycroft, with each unit consisting of a common share and a warrant to purchase another common share for US$1.068. Hycroft shares closed at US$1.39 on the Nasdaq Monday.

After peaking at US$62.55 last May, AMC shares lost 78 per cent of their value through the close of trading Monday.

Here’s how it became the giant cultural force it is today.[https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/)

Reddit is many things: the people’s forum, a repository of the dankest memes, the not-so-secret weapon against Wall Street, and “the front page of the internet”. It might also soon be known as a publicly traded company valued at [$15 billion](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/). The famed social media platform plans to take itself public sometime this year (possibly as soon as [this month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddit-initial-public-offering-ipo-news-51639645252)). Reddit has already filed preliminary IPO registration statements with the SEC and has [engaged Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/reddit-is-said-to-tap-morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-for-ipo?sref=qMIA4tzu) to guide it. 

This potential IPO represents a big moment for a company that has undeniably earned itself a prominent place in the internet zeitgeist. Internet dwellers have long turned to Reddit’s online communities for loosely moderated bonding over shared passions ranging from [tripping acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/) to [admiring the CCP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZedong/). Over years of playing host to strange worlds of bronies and NSFW video enthusiasts, the platform has contributed much slang to the [pop culture lexicon](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-wallstreetbets-glossary-a-field-guide-to-apes-stonks-tendies-AMC-GME-reddit/)*.* But the platform really showed its reach in 2021, when posters on r/WallStreetBets [orchestrated a short squeeze](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-vs-wall-street-by-the-numbers-one-year-later-wallstreetbets-gamestop-amc-cloverhealth-tesla-blackberry/) of multiple stocks including GameStop and AMC. Until Reddit goes public, the term "Reddit stock" refers to securities hyped by retail investors on the platform. The successful effort to stick it to institutional investors sent shockwaves through Wall Street and may have inspired a [DOJ inquiry](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-big-short-seller-probe-who-are-the-investors-on-the-dojs-list/) into a number of prominent short sellers. 

A company with a big role in internet history, Reddit has quite a history of its own. Its story embodies the spirit of Web2 entrepreneurship, with its college-nerd beginnings, minor trickery, and a corporate acquisition that left its founders feeling short-changed. JOIN OUR DISCORD - Talk to Traders

Shares Deteriorate; LT Target Reset:  SDC's shares fell 7% today following its earnings call, where it  reported 4Q topline growth below expectations (albeit within the lower  end of its 2021 guide), lackluster 2022 revenue guidance, and  reconfigured LT targets, which now, once again, reset the bar  meaningfully lower, calling for a mid-teens revenue CAGR (from \~+20-30%  per its latest revision). While management emphasized it has embedded a  level of conservatism in its new growth aspirations, expecting to return  to 2019 case volume levels by 2026, while gutting the cost structure,  we think it has a long trek ahead to restore confidence following  numerous missteps and missed expectations. Reflecting new restructuring  initiatives and strategy shifts, our 2022 adjusted EBITDA moves to -$50  million (vs. prior -$135 million), predicated on -1.9% topline growth  (vs. prior +6.8%) along with 1,286 bps of margin expansion (vs. prior  256 bps). Moreover, we are lowering our PT to $2.20 (from $2.30), now  1.8x our 2023E sales, and reiterating our EW with still much to prove  and many unique risks associated with its exposure to the  direct-to-consumer clear aligner market.

Detailing LT Model Reconfiguration:  SDC now expects revenue to grow at a mid-teens CAGR, predicated on  aligner shipments returning to 2019 levels by 2026, along with +4-5%  annual price increases and +15-25% growth across its oral care  portfolio. Importantly, these LT targets do not embed significant upside  from its practitioner network strategy, which it believes could enable  it to grow more closely aligned with its prior model (&gt;20%). Beyond  2022, from a margin perspective, SDC expects the gross margin to expand  50-100 bps annually on increased aligner volumes and Gen 2 manufacturing  utilization, partially offset by the lower margin profile associated  with its oral care products (where CPG products generally carry a  low-30% gross margin). Meanwhile, selling and marketing expenses are  expected to improve 300-350 bps annually (as a % of sales) with  operating leverage, modest gains on marketing efficiencies, and higher  shop utilization, while G&amp;A is expected to show 200-225 bps of  annual improvement as dollar spend growth aligns closely with inflation.  All in, SDC expects to reach positive EBITDA by 2023 and turn cash flow  positive by 2024/2025, which would suggest it does not need to raise  incremental capital, if targets are achieved. Importantly, potential  upside could stem from more profitable SmileShop footprint expansion,  retail partnerships, adjacent product expansion, professional channel  network growth, and rising success targeting higher income customers.

Drilling into 2022 Guidance:  While focus has inevitably been on SDC's new LT model, it also  disclosed 2022 targets, including revenue growth of -5.9% to +1.9% (-3.6  to +4.4% PF for OUS market exits). This guide assumes the current  inflationary environment will continue (in the HSD-LDD range), with  greater inflation driving growth to the lower end of the range, while an  improved environment would enable growth towards the higher end of its  range. Importantly, we forecast \~+3% ASP growth as incremental price  increases begin to go into effect in 2Q, along with -7.7% yoy volume  growth in 2022. Its guidance also calls for a gross margin of  72.5%-75.0%, implying 160 bps of improvement at the midpoint, driven by  better leveraging fixed costs, partially offset by a mix shift towards  lower margin oral care products. All in, SDC expects to generate an  adjusted EBITDA loss between $75 million and $25 million (\~-8% adj.  EBITDA margin at midpoint; \~in-line with our updated est.) in 2022, also  supported by cost reductions of \~$120 million related to its  restructuring efforts.  

Channel Strategy Update:  SDC currently maintains a broad channel strategy, including at-home  impression kits (\~50% of submissions), its SmileShop locations (\~50%),  and its partner network (\~negligible today). SDC net opened 24  SmileShops in 4Q (&gt;50 in 2H21), with now 188 permanent locations  (\~110 SmileShops pro forma for OUS market exits), albeit still below  YE21 levels (of 218 shops).  Importantly, we would expect the case  submission mix to shift more meaningfully towards SmileShops (from  impression kits) with a broader reopening. SDC is also increasingly  focused on capturing share in the traditionally full-service  doctor-directed channel (21 million annual ortho case starts) through  its practitioner network, where it currently has 657 partner locations  (1,200 active pipeline). This channel could represent both a growth  driver as well as a customer diversification strategy, enabling it to  reach a higher-income cohort. As a reminder, SDC's current customer base  has a median household income of \~$68k and has been much more  meaningfully impacted by the inflationary environment as the cost of  nondiscretionary items has increased sequentially every month since  early to mid-2021. Notably, SDC's partner network declined by \~100  locations due to its exit from Germany and the deactivation of DSOs and  private practices with low productivity, a dynamic we continue to  monitor going forward.I’m a beginner with the Stocks with robinhood?So I’m a beginner in the stock market I started a couple month ago with $1,100 of cash (this is just partial of my savings not rich or anything) but to my point is I started out with the free stock and slowly started buying myself low stocks that will help me grow. 3 months pass by which is today. Now I’m investing in index and got lucky with a couple of hundred bucks ,but the thing is that should I keep the different index that I have for a long term? I’m right now just focusing on the penny stocks and well just to get a little investment going during this quarantine of COVID-19.Can you get rich quick off of the stock market?Im 16, I watch a lot of internet shit and everybody says 'the stock market isn't gonna get you rich quick' but that just seems like nonsense because if i work at McDonalds and save up minimum $10,000 a year or get a carpentry or electrical apprenticeship (even better) i could just invest in more expensive yet still reliable 'empire' type stocks. So maybe my question isn't 'Can you get rich quick?' it's more why do people say its so hard? "it's not for that" etc.Best thing to use first starting out?I use Robinhood on my phones. I currently bought a few stocks from Sundance Energy and I figured I would ask if any of you have used Robinhood and if it was as good as I hope it is.Legitamate.

AlgoAlly: Based on my experience ( 3 years worth) I would not recommend any other group as far as Consistency, Transparency, Resources, Education and Trading Performance is concerned (For Day Trading). 
Con: As far as pricing 80% of people I've seen end up making their money in the 1st few trade signals but it takes newer trades 2-3 days to make their monthly subscription back. https://www.algoally.com/?ref=investwisely

Al Brooks Price Action on YouTube: Al Brooks is arguably one of the best traders to ever live and I really like his teaching style and how much time he dedicates on covering every single detail. His knowledge of the market is unmeasureable and I can't think of any other day trader on YouTube that I'd recommend over him.
